# ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER – READ BEFORE USING

**tylin.sb** is a **selfbot** (user automation script) designed to run on a personal Discord account.

**Selfbots explicitly violate Discord's Terms of Service** — specifically:

- Section 4: "You may not … use self-bots or user-bots"
- Section 3: prohibitions on automation, modified clients, and third-party software that interacts with the Discord service in unauthorized ways
- Various anti-spam, rate-limit, and client-integrity rules

By using, downloading, modifying, or even possessing this code, **you acknowledge and accept the following facts**:

1. **This software is provided strictly for educational and private, personal experimentation purposes only.**
2. **Running this selfbot on your Discord account carries an extremely high risk of permanent account termination**, including but not limited to:
   - Full account deletion / disablement
   - Permanent IP-based or device-based bans
   - Loss of all servers, messages, friends, Nitro subscriptions, boosts, purchased items, connected accounts, and any associated value
   - Rate limiting, shadow bans, or other restrictions that may render the account unusable even before a full termination
3. **I (the author, T / Tylin / Tye) assume absolutely zero responsibility or liability** for any consequences that may result from use of this code. This includes — but is in no way limited to — account loss, financial loss, emotional distress, or any other direct or indirect damages.
4. **No support will be provided** for accounts that have been actioned by Discord. Do **not** message me, open an issue, DM me on Discord, ping me anywhere, or ask for help with unbans, appeals, "why did this happen," or "can you look at my logs." The answer will always be: **you were warned — this is expected behavior from Discord.**
5. **There are no warranties of any kind**, express or implied. The software is provided "as is" without warranty of merchantability, fitness for any purpose, non-infringement, or that it will not cause harm to your account, device, or data.
6. **You are solely responsible** for understanding and complying with Discord's current Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and any applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Ignorance of the rules is not a valid excuse.
7. **If you are under 13 years old (or the applicable age of digital consent in your country), you are not permitted to use this software under any circumstances.**

**In plain English:**  
If your account gets nuked, limited, termed, shadow-banned, or otherwise fucked — **that is 100% on you**.  
You were clearly and repeatedly warned.  
I will not feel bad, I will not help, I will not appeal for you, and I will not listen to excuses.

**Proceed only if you fully accept these risks and take full personal responsibility.**
